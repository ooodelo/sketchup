# Buffer size fix comparison

## Repository solution
The implementation currently on the repository derives the binary buffer and vertex batch sizes from the import job options, persisted user settings, or the configuration defaults, and sanitizes those values before they are logged or queued for the worker thread.【F:point_cloud_importer/importer.rb†L124-L170】

Because the importer shares these sanitized parameters with the UI thread and logging helpers, downstream consumers always see consistent values, and the defaults continue to flow through the configuration pipeline (`PointCloudImporter::Config`).【F:point_cloud_importer/importer.rb†L286-L410】【F:point_cloud_importer/extension.rb†L12-L93】 This keeps a single source of truth for preferred limits and ensures the UI summary matches the actual limits applied during import.

## Previous agent solution
The previous agent patch also computed buffer and batch sizes, but it duplicated numeric-sanitization helpers directly inside the importer, even though identical logic already lives in the parser and configuration modules.【F:point_cloud_importer/importer.rb†L802-L818】【F:point_cloud_importer/ply_parser.rb†L360-L384】 Maintaining another copy of this logic inside the importer increases the risk of divergence the next time the project adjusts what qualifies as a valid buffer size.

## Evaluation
Both solutions prevent the `buffer_size` `NameError`, but the repository version better aligns with existing architecture by reusing configuration defaults and propagating a single sanitized value throughout the pipeline.【F:point_cloud_importer/importer.rb†L124-L170】 The agent’s duplication of sanitization logic adds maintenance overhead without providing additional validation coverage.【F:point_cloud_importer/importer.rb†L802-L818】【F:point_cloud_importer/ply_parser.rb†L360-L384】 For that reason, the repository solution is preferable.
